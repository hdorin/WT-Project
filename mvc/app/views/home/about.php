        <p class="sections">Our story:</p>
        <p class="para">
            It is a quite simple one: we banded together as a team because we thought
            we would go understand eachother very well and picked this at the start of the semester, AuctioX, a B-category project.

        </p>
        <p class="sections">What made us create AuctioX?</p>
        <p class="para">
            Mainly because it is 'mandatory', but aside from that, when we saw this, we were happy because we liked the idea
            of creating an auction-shopping site, the ideas were there from the beginning, we just had to muster up the courage
            to face the harsh world of HTML, CSS and PHP...

        </p>
        <p class="sections">Our Goals:</p>
        <p class="para">
            Pretty simple, implement all the functionalities needed and get a honorable mark.

        </p>
        <p class="sections">Our Partners (sellers)</p>
        <p class="para">
            We partnered up with a lot of imaginary sellers, which wholeheartedly gave us all these products to advertise and group up
            in a single place to make it easier for them to sell their products.
        </p>
        <p class="sections">How do we differ from other platfroms?</p>

            I'll leave this for you to discover.
